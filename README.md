## 👋 Hi there!

I'm a passionate **Software Developer & AI Enthusiast** with over **2 years of industry experience**. 
While my roots are in full-stack development and DevOps, my current journey is centred around the world of **Artificial Intelligence** as I pursue my **post-graduation in AI**.

---

### 🧠 Current Focus: Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

My interests now revolve around building **intelligent systems** that learn, reason, and interact. I’m actively working with:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Fine-tuning, distillation, and deployment using **Hugging Face**, **OpenAI**, and custom implementations.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Integrating vector databases like **Qdrant** for knowledge-based agents.
- **Agentic AI:** Designing **multi-agent systems** and architectures that coordinate tools, reasoning chains, and task delegation.
- **Computer Vision:** Working on CNN-based architectures for visual recognition and image classification.
- **Frameworks & Libraries:**  
  - **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **Transformers**, **LangChain**, **OpenAI Agent SDK**, **OpenCV**, **YOLO**

### 💻 Tech Stack

Though AI is my current focus, I still bring strong full-stack and DevOps expertise to any project:

#### 🔧 Full Stack Development
- **Frameworks:** .NET, Angular, Flutter, Flask

#### 💡 Programming Languages
- C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, Rust, Dart

#### 🗄️ Databases
- **SQL:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server  
- **NoSQL:** MongoDB

#### ⚙️ DevOps
- Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker, CI/CD pipelines

### 🚀 What I'm Looking For

I'm actively seeking to collaborate on projects related to:

- Applied AI: LLMs, NLP, RAG, Agent-based Systems
- Research-oriented ML/CV projects (e.g., CNNs, GANs, Transformers)
- Full Stack systems with AI integration
- AI infra setup with Docker, APIs, and scalable backends

If you're working on something in these spaces or have a crazy idea you'd like to prototype, **let’s connect!**
